## üåü Project Overview

The SCOPE Simulator is an interactive, web-based tool designed to explore and test fundamental principles of User Experience (UX), particularly focusing on **user intuition, visual perception of layouts, and interaction patterns**.

Inspired by a desire to provide empirical, interactive insights to the UX community, SCOPE aims to create a dynamic environment where researchers, designers, and developers can observe and analyze how users interact with and interpret various interface challenges.

## üéØ Vision & Purpose

In the realm of UX, understanding how layout, content density, and interactive elements influence user understanding is paramount. The SCOPE Simulator provides a unique platform to:

* **Empirically Test Intuition:** Move beyond theoretical discussions to directly observe user responses to UI patterns and questions.
* **Explore Readability Dynamics:** Dynamically adjust content layouts (e.g., line spacing, text density) to find optimal readability thresholds.
* **Study Interaction Patterns:** Present various UI challenges (like identifying save buttons or navigation elements) and observe user choices.
* **Facilitate Research:** Serve as an open-source tool for UX researchers to conduct studies on human perception and interaction design.
* **Educate & Inspire:** Offer a hands-on learning experience for aspiring and seasoned UX professionals.

## ‚ú® Features (Current & Planned)

* **Extensible Plugin System:** The simulator is built on a modular architecture where each interactive diagram is a self-contained plugin. This allows for the rapid development and integration of new test scenarios.
* **JSON-Based Question Configuration:** Test questions, diagrams, and contextual data are all defined in `public/questions.json`, making it simple to modify, add, or reorder test flows.
* **Abstract Design Philosophy:** Utilizes simplified, abstract shapes and layouts in its diagrams to isolate and test core UX principles without the distraction of realistic content.
* **Immersive Interface:** A full-screen, dark-themed UI minimizes distractions and focuses the user on the interactive challenge.
* **Future Roadmap:** Key planned enhancements include a results analytics dashboard and an AI-powered summary. For a complete overview of future features and project direction, please see the [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) file.
