## 🌟 Project Overview

The SCOPE Simulator is an interactive, web-based tool designed to explore and test fundamental principles of User Experience (UX), particularly focusing on **user intuition, visual perception of layouts, and interaction patterns**.

Inspired by a desire to provide empirical, interactive insights to the UX community, SCOPE aims to create a dynamic environment where researchers, designers, and developers can observe and analyze how users interact with and interpret various interface challenges.

## 🎯 Vision & Purpose

In the realm of UX, understanding how layout, content density, and interactive elements influence user understanding is paramount. The SCOPE Simulator provides a unique platform to:

* **Empirically Test Intuition:** Move beyond theoretical discussions to directly observe user responses to UI patterns and questions.
* **Explore Readability Dynamics:** Dynamically adjust content layouts (e.g., line spacing, text density) to find optimal readability thresholds.
* **Study Interaction Patterns:** Present various UI challenges (like identifying save buttons or navigation elements) and observe user choices.
* **Facilitate Research:** Serve as an open-source tool for UX researchers to conduct studies on human perception and interaction design.
* **Educate & Inspire:** Offer a hands-on learning experience for aspiring and seasoned UX professionals.

## ✨ Features (Current & Planned)

* **Extensible Plugin System:** The simulator is built on a modular architecture where each interactive diagram is a self-contained plugin. This allows for the rapid development and integration of new test scenarios.
* **JSON-Based Question Configuration:** Test questions, diagrams, and contextual data are all defined in `public/questions.json`, making it simple to modify, add, or reorder test flows.
* **Abstract Design Philosophy:** Utilizes simplified, abstract shapes and layouts in its diagrams to isolate and test core UX principles without the distraction of realistic content.
* **Immersive Interface:** A full-screen, dark-themed UI minimizes distractions and focuses the user on the interactive challenge.
* **Future Roadmap:** Key planned enhancements include a results analytics dashboard and an AI-powered summary. For a complete overview of future features and project direction, please see the [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) file.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get the SCOPE Simulator up and running on your local machine:

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (LTS version recommended)
* npm (Node Package Manager, usually comes with Node.js)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/scopecreepsoap/scope-simulator.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate into the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd scope
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Development Server

Start the local development server to view the application in your browser:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Required Font: PP Neue Montreal

This project uses the font **PP Neue Montreal** (Book + Medium weights).

Due to licensing restrictions, the font files are **not included** in the repo.

---

#### Option 1: If you have a licensed `.woff2` version (Recommended)

Place the following files into `src/assets/`:

* `PPNeueMontreal-Book.woff2`
* `PPNeueMontreal-Medium.woff2`

No further changes are needed — the `index.css` file already references these formats.

---

#### Option 2: If you're using the free trial version from Pangram Pangram

1. Download the font `.otf` files from [Pangram Pangram](https://pangrampangram.com/products/neue-montreal)
2. Place them in `src/assets/` as:

    * `PPNeueMontreal-Book.otf`
    * `PPNeueMontreal-Medium.otf`
3. **Update your `index.css`** `@font-face` declarations to:

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: 'PP Neue Montreal';
  src: url('./assets/PPNeueMontreal-Book.otf') format('opentype');
  font-weight: 400;
  font-style: normal;
  font-display: swap;
}

@font-face {
  font-family: 'PP Neue Montreal';
  src: url('./assets/PPNeueMontreal-Medium.otf') format('opentype');
  font-weight: 500;
  font-style: normal;
  font-display: swap;
}
```

> Without these font files, the app will fall back to system fonts and may not appear as intended.

### 🙌 Credits

**SCOPE** was designed and developed by **Sriram Bhat** as part of an independent research effort to explore cognitive bias and interface perception in traffic operations.

This work was shaped by early research collaborations and insightful contributions from:

- **Gustavo Chavez** – initial white paper collaborator and co-lead on the internal research direction
- **Dr. Katelyn Fry-Hilderbrand** – for introducing the MATB-II framework and discussions on cognitive load
- **Dr. Gopika Ajaykumar** – for expert guidance in UX and cognitive load theory throughout development
- **David Garcia** – providing UI/UX feedback, testing, and level 3 question contributions
