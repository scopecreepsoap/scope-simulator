# 🗺️ SCOPE Simulator Roadmap

This document outlines the future direction and planned enhancements for the SCOPE Simulator. It is a living document that will evolve as the project grows and community feedback is incorporated.

## 🎯 Core Principles for Future Work
* **🔬 Enhance Research Capabilities:** Features should empower UX researchers with more powerful tools for data collection and analysis.
* **🧩 Maintain Extensibility:** New features should align with the existing plugin architecture, promoting modularity and community contributions.
* **🤝 Prioritize User Consent:** Any data collection features must be strictly opt-in and transparent about what data is being collected and for what purpose.

## 🚀 Planned Features

### 1. 📈 Results Dashboard & Analytics
* **Concept:** Allow a user to upload previously downloaded `scope-results.json` files to view a detailed analysis dashboard of collected test sessions. This dashboard will include visualizations and key metrics about the performance and interaction patterns of surveyed users.
* **User Value:** This creates a powerful, self-contained analysis loop. Researchers can conduct a test, download the results, and then load them back into the application for an in-depth review with rich analytics at any time. It also enables easy sharing of aggregate test findings with colleagues.
* **Implementation Notes:** The UI entry point is the "Load SCOPE" view. The primary effort will be creating a new dashboard view that can parse the results file and present the data in a more comprehensive format than the standard end-of-test review screen, incorporating charts and metrics.

### 2. 🤖 AI-Powered Results Summary
* **Concept:** Integrate an AI on the results page that can analyze the collected answers and automatically generate draft observational notes.
* **User Value:** This will accelerate the analysis phase of research by providing an initial, objective summary of user interactions, which the researcher can then refine.
* **Implementation Notes:** The UI for this feature is already present but disabled in the results view footer.
