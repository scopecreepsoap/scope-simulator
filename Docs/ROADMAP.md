# 🗺️ SCOPE Simulator Roadmap

This document outlines the future direction and planned enhancements for the SCOPE Simulator. It is a living document that will evolve as the project grows and community feedback is incorporated.

## 🎯 Core Principles for Future Work
* **🔬 Enhance Research Capabilities:** Features should empower UX researchers with more powerful tools for data collection and analysis.
* **🧩 Maintain Extensibility:** New features should align with the existing plugin architecture, promoting modularity and community contributions.
* **🤝 Prioritize User Consent:** Any data collection features must be strictly opt-in and transparent about what data is being collected and for what purpose.

## 🚀 Planned Features

### 1. 🤖 AI-Powered Results Summary
* **Concept:** Integrate an AI assistant on the results page that can analyze the collected answers and automatically generate draft observational notes.
* **User Value:** This will accelerate the analysis phase of research by providing an initial, objective summary of user interactions, which the researcher can then refine.
* **Implementation Notes:** The UI for this feature is already present but disabled in the results view footer.

### 2. 📂 Custom Test Loading ("Load SCOPE")
* **Concept:** Allow users to load a complete SCOPE test configuration from an external source, such as an uploaded JSON file or a URL.
* **User Value:** This decouples test creation from the core application, enabling researchers to create, host, and share their own tests. This could also enable tests that use high-fidelity images (like application screenshots) instead of abstract diagrams, allowing for more specific usability testing.
* **Implementation Notes:** The UI entry point is disabled in the main navigation on the home screen. This is a significant architectural enhancement that will require careful consideration of data security and component rendering logic.

### 3. 📊 Opt-in Research Data Collection
* **Concept:** Implement a framework to anonymously collect interaction data (e.g., answer selections, time-on-task, interaction paths) from willing participants.
* **User Value:** Aggregated, anonymous data can be used to conduct large-scale studies on UX patterns, providing valuable insights to the entire community.
* **Implementation Notes:** This requires a robust, secure backend service and a clear, unambiguous user consent flow before any test begins.
