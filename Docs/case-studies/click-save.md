# Case Study: click-save

## Question Prompt
> What button on a dialog do you associate with Save?

## Diagram(s) Used
**Plugin(s)**: `save-action-selector`, `save-action-selector-l2`

This question is presented twice using two different diagrams to examine **contextual variance** in user expectations.

- The **Level 1** version shows a minimal dialog with two buttons and no form content. It’s designed to evoke a fast, instinctive response.
- The **Level 2** version simulates a form-based dialog with input fields, requiring the user to recognize structure and flow before deciding where the Save action likely resides.

Both diagrams avoid using labels, icons, or visual hints to ensure the focus remains on **spatial logic** and **user convention** rather than stylistic cues.

## UX Concept Tested
This question investigates the **mental model** users carry for Save buttons in dialogs and how that model may shift across contexts:

- Is Save expected to be **bottom-right** by default?
- Does the presence of a **form structure** influence placement assumptions?
- How do abstract vs. content-rich dialogs affect action placement?

## Level & Role
- **Level 1**: Immediate-response, low-friction
- **Level 2**: Requires task-based reasoning or workflow assumptions

This question demonstrates how a single prompt can yield **deeper insight** when used across **multiple levels and diagrams**. Level 1 captures automatic behavior; Level 2 captures reasoning influenced by context.

## Design Intent
Both versions intentionally avoid explicit labels or cues. The Level 1 design is symmetrical and abstract, encouraging the user to act on memory or expectation. The Level 2 version introduces realistic UI structure without increasing visual fidelity — creating just enough complexity to trigger deliberation.

### Progressive Difficulty
By repeating the same question with increasing structural complexity, SCOPE reveals how user expectations evolve when **interface intent is implied** rather than stated.

## What This Question Reveals
- If users follow **conventional dialog patterns** (e.g., bottom-right for Save)
- Whether Save expectations are **platform-dependent**
- How **layout and input context** affect action placement
- The difference between **muscle memory vs context-informed logic**

## Known Considerations
- Some users may reverse their choice between the two levels
- Save buttons on the left are rare but exist in older macOS and non-Western systems
- This question benefits from cross-comparison with other structural questions like Delete or Cancel

## Summary
This multi-level question is designed to reveal how **Save-button expectations change with context**. By varying visual complexity while keeping the prompt identical, it isolates the **tension between instinct and reasoning**, giving deeper insight into how users interpret UI structure in decision-critical moments.
