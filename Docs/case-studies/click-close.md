# Case Study: click-close

## Question Prompt
> Where would you click to close this dialog?

## Diagram Used
**Plugin**: `quadrant-selector`

This diagram presents an abstract dialog box divided into four corner quadrants and a center region. Users are prompted to click where they believe a close button or action would be located.

## UX Concept Tested
This question examines **spatial association with destructive or exit actions**, specifically focusing on the mental model of a “close” button in UI dialogs. It seeks to measure:

- Whether users default to the **top-right** as the location for a close action
- If visual abstraction affects that expectation
- How consistently users follow this convention across platforms or device types

## Level & Role
- **Level**: 1 (Natural)
- **Type**: Canary
- **Intent**: `"close"`

Like other Level 1 questions, this is straightforward and frictionless. It serves both as a baseline and a **canary**—a signal for whether the user is interpreting common UI tasks in expected ways.

## Canary Logic
The answer is evaluated with the following logic:

- `top-right`: ✅ Pass
- `top-left`: ⚠️ Unsure
- `anything else`: ❌ Fail

*Failing multiple canaries signals unreliability in the user’s answers and may disqualify the test results.*

## Design Intent
The diagram deliberately removes UI elements like "X" icons or borders. Instead, users rely on **spatial memory and instinct**. The grid and oval center the interaction to encourage fast, confident responses without overthinking.

## What This Question Reveals
- Whether users hold a **universal model** for closing dialogs (typically top-right)
- How strongly **platform conventions** (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS) influence spatial expectations
- If visual abstraction affects behavior when familiar icons are removed
- How SCOPE Info (Desktop, Web, Mobile, Augmented Reality) might correlate with quadrant selections
- Potential **bias detection** in users who diverge from expected patterns, despite self-reported platforms

## Known Considerations
- A small number of users may associate **top-left** with dismissal, especially if conflating with “back”
- Cultural factors or right-to-left interface exposure may slightly affect behavior

## Summary
This question is a reliable **canary and UX schema probe**. Its clarity and instinct-driven nature make it valuable to navigate simple dialog-based interactions without explicit visual cues.
