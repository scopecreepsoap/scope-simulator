# Case Study: homepage-layout

## Question Prompt
> Where would you expect to find key information on this homepage?

## Diagram Used
**Plugin**: `homepage-diagram`

This Level 3 diagram presents an abstracted homepage layout using neutral blocks to represent common content areas like headers, hero images, and feature panels. Users are asked where they would expect to find specific actions or information such as Sign Up, Log In, or Pricing.

Rather than grouping concepts like traditional card sorting, this test captures **spatial intuition** â€” identifying where users believe specific functionality should appear on a page. Each click is recorded as a coordinate, enabling **heatmap-style analysis** of user expectations.

## UX Concept Tested
- Abstracted card sorting for spatial layout understanding
- Mental models for homepage structure
- Cultural or platform-specific expectations (e.g., pricing in top nav vs footer)

## Summary
This Level 3 contribution expands SCOPE's testing capabilities by reimagining card sorting as a **visual spatial task**. It offers researchers a new lens for understanding layout expectations and abstract information architecture without relying on labels, styles, or categories.
